Description: Extensions of Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGM). Temporal Exponential Random Graph Models (TERGM) and Relational Event Models (REM). Previously also Generalized Exponential Random Graph Models (GERGM) and Temporal Network Autocorrelation Models (TNAM), but the packages for these were recently archived on CRAN. This package acts as a meta-package for several sub-packages on which it depends.
